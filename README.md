# Oceanic-image-processing

[TenGeoP-SARwv](TenGeoP-SARwv) is a labelled SAR WV dataset containing 37,553 images, it includes Ten Geophysical Phenomena from SAR wave mode (the categories are pure ocean waves (POW), wind streaks (WS), micro convective cells (MCC), rain cells (RC), biological slicks (BS), sea ice (SI), icebergs (IB), low wind areas (LWA), atmospheric fronts (AF) and oceanic fronts (OF)).

:sweat_smile: But the data set is too large(15G), I extracted 1000 images from each category, a total of 10,000.
